## Introduction

The data set of choice that is being used in this R Markdown file is [Hotel Bookings Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathsian/hotel-bookings/data).

It contains the information on 119,390 hotel bookings between 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017. Each row of a given csv file (later data frame) represents a hotel booking.

### Preprocessing the csv file (creation of hotel_bookings_02.csv)

Since freshly downloaded *hotel_bookings.csv* file contains two columns that are better understood when turned to Boolean  ("is_canceled", "is_repeated_guest"), we first did just that. Zeros (0) were turned to FALSE, and ones (1) were turned to TRUE.
